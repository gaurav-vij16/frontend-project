My first front-end project.
Developed a parallax effect using HTML, CSS Flexbox, and background images. Employed Flexbox for vertical alignment, fixed background attachment, and responsive scaling. Each section held images, delivering a scrolling parallax experience. Controlled content flow with Flexbox, initiating an engaging front-end debut.
